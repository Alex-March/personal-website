This is my personal website code to https://alexmarch.tech/, along with some projects that I've done
for the freecodecamp certifications. Planning on adding more with time!

My website is build mostly with HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript for the hamburger bar for smaller
devices, such as phones.

Main website page is in the index.html file, the projects have their own html file in the html
folder.

If you have any questions or suggections, feel free to reach out!

The code is a bit messy and I am hoping to create a newer and better version in the future.

Thanks for reading and checking it out!
